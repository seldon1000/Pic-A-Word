# Pic-A-Word
A simple cross-platform pictionary-like game in Swift, which runs on tvOS and iOS.

The idea is that the TV screen acts as a server for the multipeer connectivity. Players connects to the TV with their iPhones and then the game starts. One player draws, the others have to guess the word. The draw will be displyed on the TV so that everyone in the room will see it.

# NOTES
*The project is unfinished, and probably it will stay this way for some time.*
*This repository lacks the original assets and sound files. There are too many of them and they are not my work. This project was made possible thanks to the work of some wonderful people I had the plaesure to work with during the iOS Foundation advanced course, at the University of Naples "Parthenope". Most of them didn't contribute to this project with code, so their work and their names don't belong here. Comments and some other stuff within the code are in italian. Sorry.*
